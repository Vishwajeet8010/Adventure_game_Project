### Description

## Introduction

This is a simple adventure game written in Python. In this player can move between rooms, pick up items, and view their inventory. The game includes a few predefined rooms and items to get started.

This Python code describes an engaging story-based story where players can explore different rooms, collect
items, and navigate virtual environments.
The game is built with two main classes: Room and Player.
Room classes represent individual rooms, each with names, descriptions, and features, as well as ways to
connect to other rooms and display room information.
The Player class represents the player, keeps track of their current location and collections, and provides
ways to move between rooms and collect items.
The create_world function sets up the initial game environment by creating classes, populating objects, and
connecting them.
The play_game function handles the main game loop, processing user commands to move, retrieve objects, and
display gameÂ information.
